                <p><span>Description:</span> A financial system is a set of institutions, such as banks, insurance companies, and stock
                    exchanges, that permit the exchange of funds. Financial systems exist on firm, regional, and global
                    levels. Borrowers, lenders, and investors exchange current funds to finance projects, either for
                    consumption or productive investments, and to pursue a return on their financial assets. The financial
                    system also includes sets of rules and practices that borrowers and lenders use to decide which
                    projects get financed, who finances projects, and terms of financial deals.</p>
